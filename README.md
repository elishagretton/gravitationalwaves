# gravitationalwaves
Used Python to analyse spectograms from real gravitational-wave data of the LIGO experiment. Look at brief to see exact assignment.
Skills:
 - used pandas, numpy, matplotlib modules in Python
 - research on gravitiational waves
 - modelled data to find chirp mass
 - found best fit value of chirp mass using normal equations
 - analysed spectograms from real gravitational wave data from two sites from the LIGO experiment. 
 - used DFT (Discrete Fourier Transform) on the data to find chirp mass
